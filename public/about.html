<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Cecily L. Boucher, I am married to the most amazing dork. We have two sons, thing one (11 years old) and 
  thing two (19 years old). In the fall of 2022 we decided to enroll into college together and earn our bachelors. 
  Our goal is to provide a better life for our kids and to give us all a better future.</p>
  
  <p>My personal goals are to succefully change careers from banking and manufacturing to one in computer science. While
    banking is a great career to be in and maufacturing provides good money. I have found my enjoyment and satisfaction
    in building things in an IDE. And the feeling of fixing a bug or logic error is out of this world. Granted sometimes
    it can take hours to make your code run. The feeling is still a wonderful rush of self confidence mixed with
    relief.</p>
  
  <p>I also want to inspire my youngest to follow in our footsteps and enroll in college courses when he reaches high 
    school. And truth is if it comes down to it, I will inspire him with the most powerful parent reason for doing it........
    because I said so.</p>

<p>So, welcome to my page. Please look around at my projects and reach out to me via
  my contact page, if you have any questions or comments.</p>
