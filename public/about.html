<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Cecily L. Boucher, I am married to the most amazing man. We have two sons, 11 and 19. In the fall of 2022 we decided to 
  enroll into college together and earn our bachelors. Our goal is to provide a better life for our kids and to give us all a better
  future.</p>
  
<p>My personal goals are to succefully change careers from banking and manufacturing to one in computer science. I have found personal 
    enjoyment in taking online courses in computer science topics. I am currently enrolled into Meta's Introduction to Front-End Development 
    and working on my college degree in software engineering. </p>
    
<p>Please look around at my projects and reach out to me if you have any questions or comments.</p>
