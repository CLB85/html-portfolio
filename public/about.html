<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Cecily L. Boucher, I am married to the most amazing man. We have two sons, 11 and 19. In the fall of 2022 we decided to 
  enroll into college together and earn our bachelors. Our goal is to provide a better life for our kids and to give us all a better
  future.</p>
  
  <p>My personal goals are to succefully change careers from banking and manufacturing to one in computer science. While
    banking is a great career to be in and maufacturing provides good money. I have found personal enjoyment in computer science.
    I am currently working on my degree in software engineering and have a 3.93 GPA. </p>
  
<p>So, welcome to my page. Please look around at my projects and reach out to me via
